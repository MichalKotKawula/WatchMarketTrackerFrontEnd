      <h5>Developed the tool to fill a market gap, as the current handful of less advanced tools is only available by subscription JavaScript, HTML, Firebase, CSS, and Bootstrap.
      Integrated the Chrono24 API to fetch, display, and analyze watch brand data.
      Used algorithms to monitor market trends, calculating average prices from 100+ datasets to highlight significant shifts.
      Added an OpenAI GPT-3.5 chatbot to assist users in finding watches that match their taste.</h5>
